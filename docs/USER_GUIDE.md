# Wilds of Kanto — User Guide (1.3.0)

Visible wild Pokemon appear in the overworld. Walk into one to start that exact
wild battle. **Random Enc** (default ON) controls classic step-based random
encounters independently of visible overworld Pokémon.

This mod never changes your player spawn point and never requires the Pokédex.
Technical mod id: `overworld_wild_spawns` (stable for options/saves).

## 1. What the mod does

- Spawns tangible wild Pokemon (or hidden grass/cave markers) from each map’s real encounter table
- Behaviours: Idle Look, Grass Wander, Aggressive, Hidden markers, Water Idle/Wander
- Density scales with encounter-area size so long routes feel fuller than tiny patches
- Pokemon in tall grass use the same engine feet-overdraw as the player and NPCs
- Sprites scale for readability but never exceed one map tile (16×16); transparent
  image margins are ignored so large PNGs do not look oversized

## 2. Installation

1. Build or download `wilds-of-kanto-v1.3.0.zip`
2. In Gen1Recomp open **Mod Manager (F10)** → Import the ZIP
3. Enable **Wilds of Kanto**

The ZIP root must contain `manifest.json` directly (no wrapping folder).

## 3. Enable / disable

| Control | Effect |
|---|---|
| Mod Manager switch off | Mod not loaded; fully vanilla |
| Option **Show Wild Mons** off | Removes entities, restores vanilla grass rolls |

No game restart is required; options apply live.

## 4. Prerequisites

- Gen1Recomp with a legal Gen 1 ROM decoded
- No other mods required
- Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod is optional (Battle Art / Potato / Dramaless / Stadium2 too)

## 5. Pokédex is not required

Spawns work from the first map that has wild encounters (typically Route 1), before Oak’s parcel / Pokédex.

## 6. How visible Pokemon work

On map enter the mod:

1. Resolves the encounter surface (grass / cave / water)
2. Reads the matching encounter table
3. Finds eligible tiles and groups them into connected regions
4. Computes a target count from density settings
5. Spawns Pokemon with species/level from the table and a behaviour type

Touching a visible Pokemon (or a hidden marker) starts a battle with **that** species and level.

## 7. The four behaviours

| Behaviour | What you see | Battle |
|---|---|---|
| **Idle Look** | Stands still; glances a new direction every 5–10s | Contact |
| **Grass Wander** | Walks randomly inside its grass/cave/water region | Contact |
| **Aggressive** | Spots you in a straight facing line, shows `!`, then chases (may leave grass) | Unavoidable after alert; contact |
| **Hidden Grass / Cave** | No Pokemon sprite; grass shakes (or cave dust) | Step onto the tile |

Default mix (approximate): Idle 30% · Wander 35% · Aggressive 15% · Hidden 20%. Aggressive weight can be lowered in options.

## 8. How battles are triggered

- Exactly one battle per entity
- Species/level come from the entity (never re-rolled on contact)
- Vanilla random grass rolls are suppressed only after the spawn system is ready
- Fishing, Surf vanilla rolls, trainers, statics, and legendaries stay vanilla unless noted below

## 9. Spawn density

Target count is roughly:

```text
clamp(minVisible + floor(eligibleTiles / tilesPerAdditional), min, max)
```

adjusted by **Spawn Amount** (Low / Normal / High / Very High).

Long routes with many encounter tiles get more Pokemon. Tiny patches stay sparse. Pokemon are distributed across connected grass/cave/water regions, not all clustered next to you.

## 10. Appearance in grass

Gen1Recomp already draws tall-grass feet overdraw over every entity on a grass cell. This mod:

- Keeps Pokemon on `ow.entities` so that overdraw applies
- Avoids burying sprites with extra tuck offsets
- Scales very small art up (nearest-neighbor) so the head stays visible above the grass line

## 11. Water support

| Kind | Status |
|---|---|
| Surf / water encounter tables | **Supported** for visible water Pokemon on water tiles |
| Old / Good / Super Rod | Used for **visible** Water Mons pools (shore-distance zones); classic rod battles stay rod-triggered |
| Land species on water | Only aggressive land chase into water when a Swimming/Levitates sprite exists |

Water Pokemon stay on connected water. Classic Surf / fishing random encounters follow **Random Enc**. Aggressive water Pokemon never leave the water.

## 12. Cave support

Caves often have no tall-grass graphics but still use the grass encounter table indoors. The mod detects indoor/cave maps the same way Gen1Recomp does and spawns on walkable non-warp tiles.

- Behaviours: Idle, Wander, Aggressive, Hidden Cave (dust/shadow — not grass shake)
- Vanilla indoor encounter rolls remain the fail-safe if init fails

## 13. Options

All options are live (`mod.options_changed`). Map-density retargets on change; a map re-enter always rebuilds spawns.
Visible labels are limited to 14 characters.

Gameplay settings live in **Mod Settings** only (not duplicated in the Start menu).

**Test Spawn** is an OPTIONS activate row (no schema button type) that opens the
Pokémon list and spawns beside the player.

Density fine-tuning, sprite opacity, legacy aliases, old strict billboard
probes, and the former multi-toggle developer panel are no longer public;
runtime defaults remain in code.

## 14. Dev Overlay & Test Spawn

Enable **Dev Overlay**, then:

1. Read behaviour / facing labels above wild Pokémon
2. Optionally read the diagnostics HUD (cave reachability, water target/spacing,
   follower style status)
3. Open **Test Spawn** for a free-neighbour spawn (7 phases)

## 15. Test Spawn browser

Lists species from ROM/content data (not the Pokédex). Shows asset status and
supports Test spawn with occupancy checks.

## 16. Fallback sprites

Presentation order:

1. Follow-sprite (when the option is on and the species mapping is valid)
2. Legacy species / battle PNG
3. `assets/fallback/pokemon_missing.png`

Spawns still appear in every case. Mapping errors affect only that species.
Sprite identity always uses the numeric Pokedex / species id — never the
localized display name. Shiny follow-sprites exist in assets/preview, but
Gen1 wild spawns currently always use the normal variant.

## 17. Known limitations

- Battle-front art scaled for overworld is temporary until dedicated OW sheets ship
- Aggressive AI uses tile steps (not full NPC pixel tweening)
- Water Pokemon are a best-effort swim presentation; vanilla Surf rolls stay on
- Fishing Pokemon never free-roam
- With a Voxel overworld renderer, wild Pokemon use the same world billboards
  as trainers (depth + native grass). HGSS True Size stays on when the **active**
  renderer can consume variable SpriteDef geometry (Battle Art; Potato /
  Dramaless / Stadium2 via public `exports.lib.require`). Original Dramatic
  Shape and any renderer without that public module stay Classic 16×16.
  Flat 2D keeps True Size. Stadium2 True Size is billboard/renderer
  compatibility only — not a claim of complete Gen 2 gameplay support.
- Aggressive chase keeps a stable entity id and uses the engine `!` emote

## 17b. PMDCollab dialogue portraits

**Portraits** for Wilds-owned Pokémon dialogue (followers, town Pokémon,
generic name-derived cries like `Pika!`) always use derived
[SpriteCollab](https://github.com/PMDCollab/SpriteCollab) faces when
available. They are **not** tied to Sprite Style — Dex / HGSS / Poke-Followers
overworld styles all show the same portrait subsystem.

## 18. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| No visible Pokemon | Dev Mode HUD: encounter data? eligible tiles? renderer? |
| Only random grass | Spawn system not READY → vanilla fail-safe is working |
| Too empty on long routes | Raise **Spawn Amount** |
| Too crowded | Lower **Spawn Amount** |
| Prefer classic static sprites | Set **Sprite Style** to **Pokedex** |
| Prefer Pokemon fully above grass | Set **Grass View** to Above |
| Want classic feel | Disable Chase / Hidden Mons, or turn Show Wild Mons off |

## 19. Uninstall

Disable or remove the mod in Mod Manager. No save edits are required; entities are runtime-only.

## 20. Savegame safety

The mod does not write player position, story flags, party, boxes, items, or Pokédex. Options live in Gen1Recomp’s global options file, not inside your playthrough blob as map state.
