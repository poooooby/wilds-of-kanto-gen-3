## 2.5.3 (fork)

### Features

- Overworld and follow sprites for PokeMMO/HGSS have been updated to include every
  Pokemon through Gen 9 (1025 total species) and their shiny counterparts.
- Pokemon dialogue portraits have been updated for all species, and now display as
  true color instead of being tinted by the active Gen 1 color palette.
- Swimming and Levitate follow sprites now cover every Pokemon through Gen 9 that
  has source art available (previously limited to Gen 1-3).

### Bug fixes

- Following Pokemon that fall far behind (e.g. after the player dashes several
  tiles quickly) now catch up faster the further behind they are, instead of a
  fixed speed regardless of how big the gap is.
- Fixed some following Pokemon whose walking sprite is wider than one tile
  visually overlapping the player.

## 2.5.2 (fork)

### Features

- Expanded `lib/species_display_scale.lua`'s Voxel display-size scale table
  from 386 to 1025 entries (full Gen 1-9 National Dex), re-derived with an
  asymmetrical S-curve against a 1.5m child-height reference. Only takes
  effect for species a Pokedex-expansion mod actually registers past the
  active baseline; extra entries are otherwise inert.

## 2.5.1 (fork)

### Features

- Added a **Sprite Scale** option (on by default) that toggles the per-species
  Voxel-only display-size scale (`lib/species_display_scale.lua`). Turning
  it off makes `SpeciesGeometry.displayScale` return 1 unconditionally, so
  every HGSS/PokeMMO species renders at native True Size instead of its
  hand-tuned custom size — a full escape hatch for players who prefer
  unmodified True Size proportions. Live-toggleable from the Start Menu
  (Wilds of Kanto → SPRITE SCALE) or Mod Settings; flipping it refreshes
  already-spawned entities immediately, the same way changing Sprite Style
  does, since the scale is baked into each entity's SpriteDef at resolve
  time.

### Removed

- Removed `lib/species_display_scale_style_overrides.lua` (the per-style
  override layer on top of the shared display-scale table). Since only
  HGSS/PokeMMO ever consults the base table now (PMDCollab, the other style
  that used to need its own differently-tuned values, was removed above),
  there was no longer a second style for the override mechanism to
  differentiate — it was pure unused indirection.

- Removed PMDCollab as a selectable overworld Sprite Style (wild spawns,
  followers, and ambient/town Pokemon). It was redundant with the existing
  HGSS/PokeMMO and Poke Followers styles, and its ~11MB of walker sprite
  sheets shipped as unused bloat. Gen2 dialogue portraits — a separate
  feature that also derives from PMDCollab/SpriteCollab but is independent
  of Sprite Style — are unaffected and remain fully supported.
  - Deleted `lib/pmd_walk.lua` / `lib/pmd_idle.lua` (overworld walk/idle
    animation, portrait-unrelated) and the PMDCollab sprite provider in
    `lib/sprite_providers.lua`.
  - Deleted `assets/pmdcollab/sprites/` and `sprite_table.lua`; kept
    `assets/pmdcollab/portraits/` and `portrait_table.lua`.
  - Trimmed `scripts/import_pmdcollab.py` to portraits-only and deleted
    `scripts/audit_pmdcollab_walk.py` (audited only the now-removed walk
    sheets).
  - `lib/pmdcollab_assets.lua`'s portrait loading no longer depends on
    `sprite_table.lua` existing — previously, deleting it would have also
    broken portraits, since both were gated behind one shared readiness
    flag.
  - The Sprite Style option now offers 2 public choices (HGSS/PokeMMO,
    Poke Followers) instead of 3; an existing save with PMDCollab selected
    migrates silently to Poke Followers, the same fallback already used
    for other retired style values.

## 2.5.0 (fork)

### Features

- Added a per-species, per-sprite-style Voxel-only display-size scale
  (`lib/species_display_scale.lua`, a fully hand-authored 386-entry
  dex→multiplier table): followers and wild spawns can now render
  smaller or larger than True Size under Voxel renderers, independently
  per style (HGSS/PokeMMO, Poke Followers, PMDCollab). Only the quad's
  world-space size changes — UVs stay on the real frame, so every source
  pixel is still sampled at native resolution, and flat 2D never reads
  these fields at all. Extended to the shared Terrarium/Stadium2/
  Potato/Dramaless billboard factory, including a fix for species with
  real anchor padding (Onix) and for exact mirror-symmetry under
  quantization. Pokedex is removed from the Sprite Style menu/options
  (kept as an internal fallback style only).
- Added Battle Art Gen2 (`BATTLE_ART_VOXEL_GEN2`) as its own recognized
  provider with a dedicated adapter (`lib/compat/battle_art_gen2_geometry.lua`),
  rather than sharing Gen1's Battle Art fork file — Gen2's own
  `SpriteBillboards.halfWidth` mirror-pivot behavior genuinely differs
  from Gen1's. Fixes both wrong left/right sprite placement and, for
  species whose art width coincidentally matches a genuine "big doll"
  sprite's half-width (e.g. Charizard), placement drifting toward the
  mirrored side.
- Wilds now detects Pokedex-expansion mods (e.g. Kanto Reforged) at
  load time instead of hardcoding a Gen 3-sized species cap for every
  install: `Gen1.MAX_SPECIES`/`Gen2.MAX_SPECIES` are the true vanilla
  151/251 baselines, raised only when a live scan of
  `game.data.pokemon` (cached after the mod-load pass that Gen1Recomp
  itself guarantees completes before gameplay starts) finds species
  beyond that baseline.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed noisy `World billboard failed ...; spatial overlay emergency
  (pose() returned nil sprite)` warning spam under Voxel renderers
  (Terrarium, Battle Art) whenever wild Pokemon spawn — most visible in
  dense-grass maps like Viridian Forest. Verified via live simulation:
  every freshly-spawned entity has no billboard for its first ~0.3-0.6s by
  design (`SpawnFx` keeps the body hidden until its reveal animation
  finishes), so a Voxel renderer polling `pose()` during that exact window
  always sees a transient nil sprite that self-heals a moment later — 12/12
  simulated spawns failed at frame zero and 12/12 succeeded one second
  later, regardless of species. `lib/voxel_adapter.lua`'s `markFallback`
  now only logs when the entity's body is actually supposed to be visible
  already (`SpawnFx.bodyVisible`), so a genuinely missing sprite still
  surfaces while the expected spawn-reveal window stays silent.
- Fixed Voxel walk-cycle "snapping" on asymmetric HGSS/PokeMMO sprites:
  Gen1Recomp mirrors the whole up/down walk frame on `stepFlip` to fake a
  second gait pose for symmetric human sprites, which visibly snapped
  Wilds' left/right-asymmetric True Size art sideways, amplified by
  Voxel display scaling. Opts the PokeMMO provider into
  `disableVerticalStepFlip` (down/up facing only — left/right already
  rely on a legitimate facing-based mirror that must stay untouched),
  routed directly into followers'/wild spawns' own `pose()` since
  Voxel/Battle Art billboards read `pose()`'s flip value directly and
  never call `sprite:draw()`.
- Followers are now frozen (`frozen=true`, `wanders=false`) so
  third-party town-life mods (e.g. Terrarium's AGENDA system) stop
  reading them as ordinary idle townspeople and pulling them toward a
  scheduled post the moment the player stops walking — Wilds already
  drives every trailer's position itself.
- perf: Cached sprite-provider filesystem probes that were re-run on
  every frame/spawn attempt (`_builtinPokeFollowersReady()`'s repeated
  `mod:read` of a probe PNG, and `finalize()`'s per-`trySpawn` Gold
  pack discovery), fixing measurable spawn and per-frame lag. Cherry-
  picked from upstream YoDrehDenSwagAuf/overworld-spawn-mod#104
  (credit: Max Coplan), closes upstream #95.
- Finished the `overworld_wild_spawns` → `wilds_of_kanto_gen3` rename in
  a handful of internal log/error strings and UI option-row namespace
  prefixes that still referenced the pre-fork id after the 2.4.0
  manifest identity change.

## 2.4.2 (fork)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed wild Pokemon spawning onto, and wandering onto, cells occupied by
  native map NPCs (Strength boulders, stationary trainers, signs) in caves
  — visually indistinguishable from solid wall. Those objects live in the
  engine's own `ow.npcs` list, never in Wilds' own `ow.entities`, so
  neither the initial spawn-tile picker nor the wander/chase/flee
  collision check had any visibility into them.
  - Movement: `lib/behavior.lua`'s `occupiedBlocked` now also checks a
    `mapNpcs` list (`lib/behavior_tick.lua` fills it from `ow.npcs`)
    before allowing a step.
  - Spawn placement: `lib/grass.lua`'s `validateWalkableTile` /
    `validateEligibleTile` (and `pickFree` / `pickFreeWalkable`) now
    reject a candidate tile the same way.
  Reported live in MT_MOON_1F (wander first, then four mons found
  spawned directly on wall-like NPC-occupied tiles).
- Fixed cave reachability BFS crossing Gen1's directional elevation/ledge
  collisions (a one-way tile pair, e.g. hopping down a ledge you can't
  climb back through) as if they were plain two-way floor. `isWalkableCell`
  only reports single-cell walkability and has no concept of *direction*,
  so a pocket only reachable by looping through a completely different
  route (typically a staircase) could read as directly connected to the
  player's position, wrongly letting Pokemon spawn/wander there.
  `lib/cave_reachability.lua`'s BFS now also checks the tileset's
  directional tile-pair table (`game.data.field.tilePairs.land`, the same
  data the engine's own player-movement collision uses) before crossing
  between two cells, via `CaveReachability.build(map, player, { tilePairs
  = ... })`. Verified against real MT_MOON_1F data: the exact pocket
  reported live (`(17,20)`, `(17,28)`, `(17,31)`, `(18,34)`) now correctly
  classifies as unreachable, while unrelated reachable cells are unaffected.

### Known issues

- Variable-geometry wild Pokemon (True Size) render floating well
  above ground specifically under **Battle Art Voxel Fork** with Voxel mode
  on (correct with Voxel off, and correct under Terrarium's Voxel mode).
  Root cause not yet isolated — see the "KNOWN BUG" section in
  [docs/analysis/TRUE_SIZE_SYSTEM.md](docs/analysis/TRUE_SIZE_SYSTEM.md).
  To be corrected later.

## 2.4.1 (fork)

- Renamed to "Wilds of Kanto Revival" in manifest.json / mod.card.
- Minor description wording ("Gen 3 dex support").
- `.gitignore`: ignore `.claude/` and the local `/release` pre-release build
  output folder.
- **Generated asset path renamed**: `assets/generated/` is a path
  Gen1Recomp's modkit reserves exclusively for the player's own ROM-derived
  cache (rule MK301). This mod had shipped its own build output under that
  same path since its first release, meaning real modkit validation had
  always failed and every prior release was actually packed by
  `scripts/build-mod.py`'s manual fallback rather than the validated modkit
  path. Renamed to `assets/wilds_generated/` across the whole codebase (Lua,
  Python tooling, docs, tests, CI workflow, mod.card) so real modkit
  `validate`/`lint`/`pack` can now succeed against this mod's own files.
- Fixed `scripts/build-mod.py`: two post-generation manifest-existence
  checks (`ensure_runtime_sheets`, `ensure_water_runtime_sheets`) still
  pointed at the old `assets/generated/...` path after the rename above,
  which the generators themselves no longer wrote to.
- Fixed `scripts/build-mod.py`'s manual-pack fallback: its directory walk
  never pruned `os.walk`'s traversal (only filtered files after the fact),
  so it fully descended into huge local-only directories (a bootstrapped
  engine clone, a reference research checkout) that have nothing to do with
  the mod payload, making local rebuilds dramatically slower than
  necessary. Directories are now pruned in-place so the walk skips them
  entirely.
- Fixed `tools/generate_true_size_runtime.py` crashing on Windows
  (`UnicodeEncodeError`) whenever it printed a unicode arrow in its
  `--help` text or audit log, because Windows consoles default to the
  system codepage rather than UTF-8; stdout/stderr are now forced to UTF-8
  at startup.

## 2.4.0 (fork)

### Fork identity

- Manifest identity updated for the fork: id `wilds_of_kanto_gen3`,
  `conflicts: ["overworld_wild_spawns"]` (do not run both at once), github
  points at `poooooby/wilds-of-kanto-gen-3`. See LICENSE, README.md, and
  mod.card for fork attribution.

### Gen 3 True Size geometry

- Generated real `species_geometry.json` / `species_table.lua` entries for
  all 135 Gen 3 species (dex 252–386) from the existing HGSS-format source
  art in `assets/enhanced_overworld/followsprites`, via
  `tools/generate_true_size_runtime.py`. HGSS/Pokédex packs: 135/135;
  Swimming: 105/135; Levitate: 30/135 (matches actual source coverage);
  Followers: 0/135 (no `poke_followers` art yet for Gen 3 — falls back to
  HGSS-sized placeholder geometry). None of the existing 1–251 entries changed.
- `lib/game_compat/gen1.lua` / `gen2.lua`: `MAX_SPECIES` raised from 151/251
  to 386. This was the actual blocker for Gen 3 True Size sizing — the
  geometry data alone was unreachable because `SpeciesGeometry.normalizeDex`
  capped every lookup at the old generation ceiling before ever consulting
  the table.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed **Chase Mons** (`enable_aggressive`) not disabling aggressive
  behaviour for water/swimming Pokémon. `Behavior.weightsFor`'s
  `water_aggressive_chance` rescale unconditionally recomputed
  `WATER_AGGRESSIVE`'s weight from idle/wander weights, silently
  resurrecting it after `enable_aggressive` had already zeroed it — since
  `spawn_logic.lua` always passes a real `water_aggressive_chance` value,
  this fired on every water spawn regardless of the option.
- Fixed cave Pokémon spawning/wandering outside reachable areas after a
  same-map warp into a different cave component. Every cave entity (not
  just "Mixed"-mode scenery) was pinned to a per-entity snapshot of the
  reachable-cells table captured at spawn time; `CaveReachability`
  rebuilding that table on a same-map warp left existing entities validating
  movement against stale, pre-rebuild data instead of the live mask.

### Terrarium Voxel renderer compatibility

- Added `lib/compat/terrarium_variable_geometry.lua`: True Size support for
  the [Terrarium](https://github.com/BrenoBertucci/Terrarium) Dramatic Shape
  fork, alongside the existing Battle Art / Potato / Dramaless / Stadium2
  adapters. Terrarium exposes the same `exports.lib.require` /
  `SpriteBillboards` / `Voxel3D` / `VoxelState` contract, so it reuses the
  shared `compat/voxel_sprite_billboards_adapter` factory.

## 2.3.0 (fork)

### Gen 3 species preview (PMDCollab)

- `lib/species_assets.lua` now maps Gen 1–3 (species IDs 1–386). Preview
  quality: relies on the companion **Kanto Reforged** mod (GPLv3) for Gen 3
  species data (stats, types, moves, dex entries) via `game.data.pokemon` at
  runtime — no Kanto Reforged code or data is copied into this repository.
- New PMDCollab overworld sprites and independent dialogue portraits for
  species #252–386.
- PMDCollab imported revision bumped to `a3acb77f05fb6649df2790031a1285066ffa32f2`.

## 2.2.0

### PMDCollab / SpriteCollab support

- New optional **Sprite Style: PMDCollab** (`pmdcollab`) with derived Gen1–Gen2
  Walk sheets and occasional presentation-only Idle animations. Default style
  remains Poke Followers / GSC.
- Independent **PMDCollab portraits** for Wilds follower talk, town Pokémon
  talk, and generic cry text — works under every Sprite Style (Dex / HGSS /
  Poke-Followers / PMDCollab).
- Authoring importer: `scripts/import_pmdcollab.py` (local SpriteCollab
  checkout → `assets/pmdcollab/`). CC BY-NC 4.0 attribution in
  `THIRD_PARTY_ASSETS.md` and `assets/pmdcollab/CREDITS.txt`.
- Water: no Swim in SpriteCollab for #001–251 → existing Wilds water system.

## 2.1.9

### Follower RELEASE / RECALL presentation FX

- Intentional Follow / Dismiss / follower-count / party switch now play a short
  Poké Ball-style scale / tint / alpha effect. Gameplay selection updates
  immediately; recall uses presentation-only ghosts. Technical rebuilds stay
  seamless.
- Poké Center heal temporarily suppresses visible party trailers while the
  nurse heal-machine animation runs (`ow.healAnim`), reusing the same FX.
  Configured `follower_count` / options / save are never overwritten.
- Talking to a Wilds trailer offers **Ok** / **Ball** after the follow message.
  **Ball** sets `mon.stopFollowing`, decrements follower count, and reuses
  recall FX so that mon stays excluded across map, battle, and Poké Center
  restore. Yellow stock Pikachu keeps vanilla talk.
- Gen1 talk-Ball recall is deferred until Overworld owns the tick (ChoiceBox
  still holds the talked-to NPC). Recall ghosts attach to `ow.entities` only
  with a dummy `def`, so `checkTrainerSight` never sees them. Gold talk-Ball
  stays immediate.
- Gen1 OverworldState draws via `e:draw(camX, camY)` (scale nil); the
  presentation FX wrap now applies tint / scale on that camera-arity path and
  rebinds recall ghost sprites so wraps sample the ghost. Gen2's scale path is
  unchanged.

### Follower faint failover

- When the selected follower faints outside battle, permanently fail over to
  the topmost healthy party mon via `selectFollower` so visible follower,
  DISMISS, and save mirrors stay aligned.

### Pokémon Tower Marowak spawn reserve

- Reserve Pokémon Tower 6F `(10, 16)` from Wilds spawns until
  `EVENT_BEAT_GHOST_MAROWAK` so the scripted Marowak battle cannot collide with
  an overworld Wilds encounter.

### Gold Farfetch'd Pokédex art

- Prefer Gold's live `spriteFront` over stale Gen1 `registrationInfo` in the
  Pokédex provider for Gen2 only.

### Enc Silhouette — Undiscovered

- `wild_silhouettes` is now **Off** / **Undiscovered** / **All** (bool
  migration preserved). Undiscovered silhouettes species not yet caught /
  registered in the Pokédex; a presentation fingerprint bit recolors on
  discovery without a map change.

## 2.1.8

### Overworld throw Ball sprites

- Thrown Overworld Catching Balls use new 22×22 source art packed into
  `assets/balls/throw/*.png` (16×16 SpriteDef canvas, nearest-neighbor).
- Visible throw art is ~8×8, centered at offset (4, 4) so the Ball sits
  closer to overworld trainer/Pokémon scale than the previous ~10×10 pack.
- Lookup is by stable Ball ID (`POKE_BALL` / `GREAT_BALL` / `ULTRA_BALL` /
  `MASTER_BALL`). Catch HUD still uses `assets/balls/*.png`.
- Catch HUD Size remains UI-only: size 0 hides the HUD, not the projectile.

### Gen2 live settings movement

- Toggling Idle / Roam / Chase / Hidden Mons now re-evaluates **existing**
  overworld Pokémon once: disabled-behaviour state is cleared, entity identity
  and sprites are preserved, and the ~30 Hz AI cadence is re-asserted.
- Root cause: OPTIONS / `Pipelines.applyOptions` restored WILDS AI to OFF
  (the pipeline row is hidden), so Gold wilds were only ticked from
  `world.stepped` (per player tile) until the next map enter re-synced the
  pipeline. Route reload looked like a movement fix because `initializeForMap`
  called `syncPipelineLevel`.

### Follower map seams

- Outdoor walking seams (city ↔ route, route ↔ route) no longer require
  `via=connection`. If the engine omits `via`, an outdoor edge walk still
  carries the recent trail instead of parking the party on the player for
  1–3 steps. Doors / warps still park on the player.

### Settings / README

- Public settings are exactly `options.lua`. Indoor Pokémon and WILDS AI are
  no longer in-game menu rows (they were never Mod Manager options).
- Enc Silhouette is documented. README settings tables match schema defaults.

### Release ZIP packaging (Defender Wacatac investigation)

- v2.1.6's published `Wilds.of.Kanto.v2.1.6.zip` was a GitHub source archive
  (`overworld-spawn-mod-main/`), not `scripts/build-mod.py` output. It included
  `scripts/`, `tools/` (PowerShell + Python), `tests/`, and `.github/`.
- Official packer still excludes those paths. Hygiene verification now rejects
  authoring/host scripts and source-archive wrappers so a source ZIP cannot
  be published as the user-facing release asset.
- Manager metadata (`manifest.description`, `mod.card`, `options.lua` labels
  / descriptions) uses ASCII `Pokemon` / `Pokedex` / `Poke Ball` so the
  release workflow can pack. The previous `é` / `×` / `→` failed
  `validate-manager-ascii` and blocked the official ZIP. Runtime keys and
  gameplay are unchanged.
- Option label **Ball Switch Key** shortened to **Ball Switch** (14-char Mod
  Manager limit). Internal key `catch_cycle_key` is unchanged.
- See `docs/release-av-diagnosis-v2.1.6.md`.

### Stadium2 Voxel — HGSS True Size billboards

- HGSS True Size no longer falls back to Classic 16×16 when
  **STADIUM2_OVERWORLD_MODELS** (Gen 2 voxel renderer) is the **active**
  Voxel renderer. Wilds installs
  `lib/compat/stadium2_variable_geometry.lua` through the existing
  SpriteBillboards factory (same wrap as Potato / Dramaless): `mesh` /
  `shadowQuad` consume `frameWidth` / `frameHeight` / `anchorX` /
  `anchorY`. Vanilla 16×16 characters stay on the original mesh.
- Native Stadium2 variable-geometry support (export flags or
  `SpriteBillboards` using `frameWidth` / `getFrameGeometry`) is detected
  and is **not** double-wrapped.
- Missing / broken Stadium2 lib stays Classic with an honest fallback
  reason. Wilds does not copy Stadium2 source or patch its files on disk.
- This is **renderer** compatibility (Wilds SpriteDef → Stadium2
  billboards) for wilds, followers, ambient, and water sprites. It does
  not claim complete Gen 2 gameplay compatibility.
- If a Stadium2 build embeds its own Wilds runtime, coexistence must be
  fixed in that repository. Wilds only probes public exports; it does
  not disable Stadium2 event handlers.

### Catch HUD Size 0 = hidden

- **Catch HUD Size** now allows **0–10**. **0** hides the Catch HUD only;
  Overworld Catching, meter, range tiles, ball switching, and throws stay
  active. Default remains **5**.

### Configurable Overworld Catch controls

- New Wilds settings: **Catch Key**, **Ball Switch**, **Catch Combo**,
  **Switch Combo**. Defaults stay **C** / **Q** / **B+A** / **B+Left/Right**.
- Bindings live in `lib/catching/bindings.lua`. Catch timing, meter, HUD,
  projectile, and TouchControls are unchanged.
- Desktop keys and logical Game Boy combos remain parallel. Controller/touch
  presets use logical `a` / `b` / `select` / `left` / `right`.
- Changing a Catch binding live-cancels an in-progress meter (no Ball consumed).
- If Catch Key equals Ball Switch, throw wins and cycle falls back to Q
  (or E when Catch Key is Q).

### Species → canonical Wilds asset identity

- Overworld / follower / water / True Size sprite lookup now maps
  `mon.species` → `SpeciesAssets.idFor` → canonical Wilds asset ID.
- Runtime Pokédex order (`mon.dex` / `GameCompat.speciesId`) is no longer
  used as a Wilds sheet index. Reordered Dex mods keep the correct art
  (MEWTWO → 150, TYRANITAR → 248). Unknown Fakemon use the missing-sprite
  fallback instead of another Pokémon's sheet.
- Numeric HGSS / Poké Followers / swimming / levitate / True Size asset
  layout is unchanged. Gameplay Dex uses (encounters, battles, Pokédex)
  are unchanged. Sandbox access stays on current `lib/wilds_fs.lua`.

### Measure-driven performance

- AI / occupancy / cave decision work runs at a fixed ~30 Hz. Movement
  interpolation, spawn FX, animation sync, and battle-return reattach
  stay per rendered frame so 60/120/144 Hz remains smooth and v2.1.5
  battle-return is not delayed.
- Occupancy rebuilds only when dirty or the player/trailer fingerprint
  changes. Battle-return / follower / ambient / world-replacement
  reattach still force a rebuild.
- Voxel presence safety-polls about twice a second; inactive entities
  take an early-out. Battle Art / Potato / Dramaless adapters are
  unchanged.
- Unchanged presentation skips sprite re-resolve and `SpriteRenderer.new`.
  World attachment is a separate concern from rendering identity.
- DEV-only `lib/perf_stats.lua` snapshot (no release log spam).

### Yellow follower freeze without Pikachu

- CONTROL=TRAINER trailers no longer freeze at spawn in Yellow when Pikachu
  is not in the party. Vanilla `PikachuFollower.shouldSpawn` is only used as
  a cutscene gate while the stock Yellow Pikachu follower is actually active.

### Gold trainer-controlled followers

- CONTROL=TRAINER trailers now construct Gold NPCs with the native
  `NPC.new(mapId, objDef, spriteDef)` contract from
  `src/world/gen2/Npc.lua` / `Follower.lua` (`MOVE.STANDING_DOWN`,
  `passable`, `world.npcs` + `world.entities`). `Gen2.makeGuestNpc` no
  longer sniffs `NPC.MOVE` to fall back to Gen1 `NPC.new(data, mapId,
  def)`. That fallback is what unit tests were exercising: the mock
  accepted Gen1 arity, while live Gold's Gen1 `draw(camX, camY)` is
  invisible under `World:drawPeople`'s `draw(ox, oy, scale)`.
- Player = Pokémon, wilds, and town Pokémon are unchanged. Gen1 follower
  construction is unchanged.

### Experimental Pokémon Gold wild encounters

- Gold now shows visible overworld Wild Pokémon using the **shared** Wilds
  entity / render / AI layer. Species, levels, and time-of-day groups come
  from Gold's kind-first `data.gen2Encounters` tables via
  `lib/gen2/encounters.lua` — not from Kanto tables and not from Pokédex
  habitat data.
- Gold HGSS / Poké Followers **water** Wilds were still monochrome after the
  land color fix: Followers called `LuminanceSheet.pathFor` on the colored
  `submergedFor` sheet whenever PaletteFX was not `redpp`, and HGSS swimming /
  levitate packs used the same `not redpp` luma gate in `VariableSize.applyToDef`.
  Gold `gbc` is not `redpp`, so SpriteRenderer baked DMG OBP. Gen2 water now
  keeps colored RGBA (`trueColor = true`); foam/waterline stays. Enc Silhouette
  / hidden silhouettes still black-out. Gen1 water luminance is unchanged.

- Touching a visible wild starts a **normal Gold wild battle**
  (`start_battle` / `wild` / species / level) exactly once.
- Aggressive Wilds on Gold use the **Gold World emote contract**
  (`{ image, entity, left }`). Writing the Gen1 `{ npc, frames, onDone }`
  bubble onto Gold World was crashing in `World:update` when a spawned
  Pokémon saw the player. The shared Behavior state machine is unchanged.
- Curated Johto town Pokémon (`lib/gen2/town_pokemon.lua`) spawn as NPC-like
  ambient guests (non-aggressive, no Pokédex, not encounter tables) on
  New Bark, Cherrygrove, Violet, Azalea, Goldenrod, Ecruteak, Olivine,
  Cianwood, Mahogany, and Blackthorn.
- HGSS True Size / runtime sprite generation range extends to **251**.
  Existing 1..151 geometry is unchanged.
- Safari stays **off** on Gold. Bug-Catching Contest / special engine
  catch sessions disable overworld throws.

### Gold overworld catching

- Gold uses the **shared** Wilds catching UX (HUD, selected ball, power
  meter, projectile, targeting, hit detection, success/failure, input).
- Engine-specific inventory, Mon construction, party/box, Pokédex, and
  catch-rate/ball rules go through `GameCompat` → `Gen1` / `Gen2`.
- Gen1 Red / Blue / Yellow catching is a behavior-preserving wrap of the
  previous `Bag` / `Pokemon.new` / `Party.add` / `Boxes.deposit` path.
- Gold consume uses the native bag (`save.inventory` + `Bag.remove`).
  A successful catch builds a real Gold mon via `src.battle.gen2.Mon.new`,
  adds it to `save.party` or the current Gold PC box, and stamps
  `pokedex.caught` / `pokedex.seen` with the entity species id (never a
  Wilds asset id).
- Shared `CatchMath` throw-quality / facing / level modifiers stay.
  Ball multipliers and Master Ball remain inside each generation's
  native `Catching.attempt`. Gen1 probabilities are unchanged.
- Catching no longer assumes Gen1 `mod.world:overworld()` / `ow.player` /
  `ow.textbox:active()` / stack-top-is-overworld. Gold resolves
  `GameCompat.catchWorld` → `game.world` and `GameCompat.catchPlayer` →
  the native Gold Player. Control uses `World:busy` / `textbox` latch /
  empty-stack free roam. Thrown balls attach to Gold `npcs` so
  `World:drawPeople` can see them. A failed `Mon.new` now returns nil
  (no fake party table). Gen1 catching guards are unchanged.
- Gold B+A / C meter no longer runs Gen1 RangePreview world lookup
  (`mod.world:overworld()`) or the `OverworldState.drawWorld` monkey-patch.
  Green ground cells are disabled on Gold (no worldCanvas pass). HUD meter,
  throw, and catch stay on. Gen1 ground preview is unchanged.

### Experimental Pokémon Gold foundation

- Production `manifest.json` now targets **Gen 1 + Gen 2** via
  `"games": ["gen1", "gen2"]` (Mod Manager label **Gen 1+2**). Legacy
  `gen2compat` is not used. `game_version` stays `>=0.0.0-0 <2.0.0`.
- `lib/game_compat/gen2.lua` is a real Gold adapter (`supported = true`)
  for species, party, surf, map id, water cell, encounters, and town Pokémon.
- Red / Blue / Yellow gameplay is unchanged (full Gen1 capabilities).

### Internal multi-generation preparation

- Added a small `lib/game_compat.lua` facade so shared Wilds code can ask
  which generation is running and resolve species / party / surf / map id
  through that layer. Follower species lookup uses `GameCompat.speciesId`.
- Generation detection uses Gen1Recomp `GameVersion.get()` +
  `GameVersion.generation(id)` when the engine module is present.
- Gen1 True Size / diagnostic dex cap (`151`) is owned by `Gen1.MAX_SPECIES`.

## 2.1.7

### Release ZIP packaging (Defender Wacatac investigation)

- v2.1.6's published `Wilds.of.Kanto.v2.1.6.zip` was a GitHub source archive
  (`overworld-spawn-mod-main/`), not `scripts/build-mod.py` output. It included
  `scripts/`, `tools/` (PowerShell + Python), `tests/`, and `.github/`.
- Official packer still excludes those paths. Hygiene verification now rejects
  authoring/host scripts and source-archive wrappers so a source ZIP cannot
  be published as the user-facing release asset.
- Manager metadata (`manifest.description`, `mod.card`, `options.lua` labels
  / descriptions) uses ASCII `Pokemon` / `Pokedex` / `Poke Ball` so the
  release workflow can pack. The previous `é` / `×` / `→` failed
  `validate-manager-ascii` and blocked the official ZIP. Runtime keys and
  gameplay are unchanged.
- Option label **Ball Switch Key** shortened to **Ball Switch** (14-char Mod
  Manager limit). Internal key `catch_cycle_key` is unchanged.
- See `docs/release-av-diagnosis-v2.1.6.md`.

### Stadium2 Voxel — HGSS True Size billboards

- HGSS True Size no longer falls back to Classic 16×16 when
  **STADIUM2_OVERWORLD_MODELS** (Gen 2 voxel renderer) is the **active**
  Voxel renderer. Wilds installs
  `lib/compat/stadium2_variable_geometry.lua` through the existing
  SpriteBillboards factory (same wrap as Potato / Dramaless): `mesh` /
  `shadowQuad` consume `frameWidth` / `frameHeight` / `anchorX` /
  `anchorY`. Vanilla 16×16 characters stay on the original mesh.
- Native Stadium2 variable-geometry support (export flags or
  `SpriteBillboards` using `frameWidth` / `getFrameGeometry`) is detected
  and is **not** double-wrapped.
- Missing / broken Stadium2 lib stays Classic with an honest fallback
  reason. Wilds does not copy Stadium2 source or patch its files on disk.
- This is **renderer** compatibility (Wilds SpriteDef → Stadium2
  billboards) for wilds, followers, ambient, and water sprites. It does
  not claim complete Gen 2 gameplay compatibility.
- If a Stadium2 build embeds its own Wilds runtime, coexistence must be
  fixed in that repository. Wilds only probes public exports; it does
  not disable Stadium2 event handlers.

### Catch HUD Size 0 = hidden

- **Catch HUD Size** now allows **0–10**. **0** hides the Catch HUD only;
  Overworld Catching, meter, range tiles, ball switching, and throws stay
  active. Default remains **5**.

### Configurable Overworld Catch controls

- New Wilds settings: **Catch Key**, **Ball Switch**, **Catch Combo**,
  **Switch Combo**. Defaults stay **C** / **Q** / **B+A** / **B+Left/Right**.
- Bindings live in `lib/catching/bindings.lua`. Catch timing, meter, HUD,
  projectile, and TouchControls are unchanged.
- Desktop keys and logical Game Boy combos remain parallel. Controller/touch
  presets use logical `a` / `b` / `select` / `left` / `right`.
- Changing a Catch binding live-cancels an in-progress meter (no Ball consumed).
- If Catch Key equals Ball Switch, throw wins and cycle falls back to Q
  (or E when Catch Key is Q).

## 2.1.6

### Species → canonical Wilds asset identity

- Overworld / follower / water / True Size sprite lookup now maps
  `mon.species` → `SpeciesAssets.idFor` → canonical Wilds asset ID.
- Runtime Pokédex order (`mon.dex` / `GameCompat.speciesId`) is no longer
  used as a Wilds sheet index. Reordered Dex mods keep the correct art
  (MEWTWO → 150, TYRANITAR → 248). Unknown Fakemon use the missing-sprite
  fallback instead of another Pokémon's sheet.

### Measure-driven performance

- AI / occupancy / cave decision work runs at a fixed ~30 Hz. Movement
  interpolation, spawn FX, animation sync, and battle-return reattach
  stay per rendered frame so 60/120/144 Hz remains smooth and v2.1.5
  battle-return is not delayed.
- Occupancy rebuilds only when dirty or the player/trailer fingerprint
  changes. Unchanged presentation skips sprite re-resolve.

### Gold catch HUD

- Gold catch HUD is pinned to the 160×144 playfield corner.
- Catch meter ticks on the shared input step; Flat range preview uses
  World camera × zoom. Voxel Gold still skips ground tiles. Gen1 layout
  is unchanged.

## 2.1.5

### Compatibility fixes

- Updated compatibility with the newest Gen1Recomp sandbox.
- Fixed Wilds/followers/town Pokémon disappearing after battles.
- Fixed follower reattachment after returning to the overworld.

## 2.0.2

### Voxel True Size — provider-scoped adapters

- HGSS True Size in Voxel is gated on the **active** Voxel renderer, not on
  “some Voxel mod is installed”. Battle Art, Potato Voxel (`potato_voxel`),
  Dramaless (`DRAMALESS_SHAPE`), and original Dramatic Shape are distinguished.
  If more than one Voxel mod is installed and Wilds cannot tell which
  `VoxelState` is active, HGSS stays Classic 16×16 rather than guessing.
- **Battle Art Voxel** (`BATTLE_ART_VOXEL_FORK`): existing in-memory
  `SpriteBillboards` adapter is unchanged.
- **Potato Voxel** (`potato_voxel` 1.4.0): current main exposes
  `exports.lib.require`. Wilds installs
  `lib/compat/potato_voxel_variable_geometry.lua` (wrap `mesh` / re-point
  `shadowQuad`). Potato’s dedicated `shadowBlob()` contact shadow is left
  unchanged. If that public accessor is missing, HGSS uses Classic.
- **DRAMALESS_SHAPE** (1.6.4): current main also exposes `exports.lib.require`.
  Wilds installs `lib/compat/dramaless_variable_geometry.lua` the same way
  (body, occlusion silhouette, and sprite-mesh shadows). If the public
  accessor is missing, HGSS uses Classic.
- **Original Dramatic Shape**: Classic 16×16 unless the mod already exports
  native variable-geometry support. Wilds does not wrap it.
- No Voxel renderer source is copied into Wilds. No installed Voxel files are
  patched on disk.

## 2.0.1

### Battle Art Voxel — True Size billboards

- HGSS True Size no longer falls back to Classic 16×16 when **Battle Art Voxel
  Fork** (`BATTLE_ART_VOXEL_FORK`) is the active Voxel renderer. Wilds installs
  a small in-memory adapter (`lib/compat/battle_art_variable_geometry.lua`) that
  wraps public `SpriteBillboards.mesh` / `shadowQuad` so billboards, shadows,
  and occlusion silhouettes use `frameWidth` / `frameHeight` / `anchorX` /
  `anchorY`. Vanilla 16×16 characters are unchanged. Dramaless / unsupported
  Dramatic Shape still use Classic. No Battle Art source files are copied or
  patched on disk.
- `VariableSize.canUseTrueSizeInVoxel()` reports live capability (adapter or
  upstream export), not a version number.

### Follower convoy fixes (True Size / HGSS sprites)

- **Tight 1-cell trail:** follower spacing is now a strict one-cell snake
  regardless of species size. The old whole-cell size gaps (Onix 3, XL 2…)
  spread big sprites far behind the player and made the pack look detached;
  now every follower sits exactly one cell behind the one in front, so giants
  stay close to the player.
- **Reversal chain-break deadlock fixed:** doubling back over walked ground
  scrambled the pack (lag goals on the folded trail pointed at each other's
  cells and the strict cell reservations deadlocked it — the chain froze
  inverted). Followers can now swap adjacent cells to un-jam, and a jam
  recovery re-forms the pack along the player's actual walked trail if it
  ever stalls. Scrambled packs recover quickly (8 stalled frames for an
  inverted pack, ~0.13s; 16 for other stalls); the entry drain is never
  treated as a jam. Long reversals, zigzags, and mid-drain reversals converge
  back to ordered 1/2/3 spacing. The inverted fast path is deliberately not
  instant: a tightly packed train momentarily reads as inverted mid-fold on
  an ordinary reversal, and an instant teleport there read as a "slingshot"
  pop on tall True Size sprites — the swap allowance resolves those folds by
  walking instead.
- **Reversal fold no longer dashes (the True Size "slingshot"):** on a
  doubled-back trail the lag-indexed goals jump 2+ cells, which the
  catch-up pass treated as "falling behind" and answered with double
  cadence — every member then shot through the fold at 2× speed, the most
  visible slingshot on the tall HGSS sheets.  Double cadence is now
  reserved for genuine stragglers (head-distance more than one cell beyond
  the trailer's convoy slot); the fold resolves by walking at normal
  cadence with the swap allowance, reading as a smooth turnaround.

### Luminance shading for True Size sheets

- HGSS True Size land, water (swimming/levitate), and Pokédex sheets are now
  luminance-shaded exactly like the Classic/GSC art: every COLORS mode except
  ADVANCED serves a 3-shade luminance ramp (derived from the coloured sheet
  at load, cached in the save dir) with `trueColor = false` so the engine's
  zone pass colours them; ADVANCED keeps the coloured sheet raw. Previously
  the big sheets drew raw colour in classic modes.
- Voxel True Size is enabled for Battle Art Voxel Fork when the in-memory
  SpriteBillboards adapter installs; Dramaless / unsupported Dramatic Shape
  still fall back to Classic geometry automatically.

### Wild Encounter Silhouettes now black out under True Size (HGSS)

- The Global Encounter Silhouettes toggle (blacked-out wilds in grass/cave
  and water) now works with True Size HGSS sprites. The bind-time
  `VariableSize.applyToDef` rebind used to swap the derived silhouette sheet
  back to the coloured true_size image (and luminance ramp), so silhouettes
  only applied to Classic/GSC art. Wilds' bind now passes `keepImage` (with
  `skipLuminance`) for silhouette results: the pre-shaded sheet survives and
  only the pack geometry is re-asserted, so tall sheets stay blacked out
  without ever baking 16×16 quads.
- The `wildSilhouette` flag now survives the SpriteResolver cache, so a
  cached resolve (re-entry, palette flip, surface/style change) cannot
  silently un-black a wild mon on rebind.

### Reversal folds resolve by walking — the slingshot is really gone

- The fold swap was reading the STALE `_wildsGoalX/Y` (the last goal a
  follower STARTED toward, which equals its own cell once it lands) instead
  of the live goal from the trail table, so adjacent followers crossing at a
  reversal never registered as an exchange. The pack deadlocked, and the
  jam-recovery then TELEPORTED it to re-seeded cells — the visible pop on
  tall True Size sprites (an ordinary reversal re-seeded all three
  followers). The swap now reads the live goal first.
- The swap is also feasibility-checked: an exchange is only granted when the
  occupant can actually reach the stepper's cell this frame (its goal is not
  the head or the player's current cell). Without this, the stale-goal fix
  made followers step INTO a packmate whose goal was unreachable — overlap.
- A trailer mid-step into a cell the player is about to re-enter (zigzag /
  doubled-back) now aborts that step instead of landing on the player.
- Net result: straight walks, reversals, long reversals, zigzags, mid-drain
  reversals, corners, and their horizontal (left/right) mirrors all resolve
  by walking at normal cadence with zero jam-recovery teleports and zero
  overlaps.

### Jam-recovery re-seeds faster and lands the pack spread out

- The scrambled-pack fast path is quicker: an inverted (genuinely scrambled)
  pack now re-seeds after ~4 stalled frames instead of 8, and the cooldown
  between re-forms dropped from 60 to 40 frames. Since the fold fixes above,
  momentary folds resolve by walking and never accumulate on the jam
  counter, so the fast path only ever fires on true deadlocks — firing it
  sooner snaps the pack back before the player has walked far, so the
  re-seed no longer reads as a big teleport.
- Re-seed goals are now DEDUPED: on a doubled-back trail the same physical
  cell can appear at several lags, and the old re-seed copied those aliases
  verbatim — two followers landed on one cell, instantly re-jammed, and a
  second reform fired ~40 frames later (the persistent "lost placement" on
  True Size sprites). The re-seed now claims each cell once and walks
  stragglers to distinct cells behind the player, so a single reform lands
  the whole pack in order.

### Overlapping followers no longer flicker (draw-order tiebreak)

- The engine y-sorts overworld entities by `py` and only tie-breaks
  `pikachuFollower` (which trailers must never set — stock findFollower
  would remove them), so two followers sharing a cell — entry parking
  stacks the whole pack under the player, reversals fold adjacent
  followers across each other, re-seeds land on the same cells — sorted
  with an arbitrary, frame-varying order. On tall True Size sprites that
  is a visible shimmer/flicker between the two overlapped Pokémon, worst
  while running, when the pack is perpetually mid-step and overlapping.
- Every trailer now carries a deterministic sub-pixel `py` bias
  (`-slot * 0.001`, re-applied on every py write: spawn, step
  interpolation, landing, placement): the leader draws on top of the
  pack, and the whole pack draws just under the player's exact py. The
  bias is invisible (below a pixel) and only makes the engine's sort
  stable — the same order every frame, regardless of input order, so
  overlapped sprites hold still instead of swapping back and forth.

### Running again works with left/right steering (B-modifier catch)

- The mobile/controller B-modifier catching combo (B+left/right to cycle
  balls) was eating left/right for the whole B hold — and B is also the run
  button in common running-shoes setups, so players could not steer while
  running. The combo now only engages when it is clearly catching intent:
  the player must be standing still (past a one-step re-arm window) AND have
  a ball to cycle. With no balls, or mid-step, B+left/right passes straight
  through to movement. B+A charging and the desktop C/Q throw are unchanged.

### Surf sprites stay True Size (no more GSC classic fallback)

- In True Size mode the water registry silently served the classic 16×96
  water_runtime sheet whenever the true_size swimming/levitate asset for a
  species was missing — Nidoran♀/♂ (dex 29/32) are listed in the swimming
  mapping as form entries but have no generated true_size art, so surfing
  with them dropped straight back to the GSC classic sprite while every
  other mon stayed giant. A failed True Size swap (missing asset / no pack
  geometry) is now treated as a miss: the registry falls through to the next
  water kind, and finally to the land fallback — which IS True Size — so a
  True Size session never shows the classic 16×96 sheets. Classic-effective
  sessions (Voxel fallback / engine API missing) are unchanged and still
  serve the classic sheets.
- The follower pack's own water rebind (ControlEngine trailer refresh) was
  still forcing the GSC poke_followers submerged art onto water trailers in
  **every** sprite style — in HGSS / True Size sessions it clobbered the
  giant swimming/levitate sheet the resolver had just served, so surfers
  still saw the small GSC sprite. The submerged art is now only derived for
  the GSC / Poke Followers style; HGSS (True Size) and Pokédex trailers fall
  through to the style's own water sheets (true_size swimming/levitate /
  registry) exactly like the wild water path.

## 2.0.0

Major overworld presentation release: HGSS True Size, overworld catching, and
water/follower polish — with two final scale fixes below.

### HGSS True Size / native variable-size overworld sprites

- HGSS / PokeMMO Sprite Style uses native HGSS land artwork as the visual size
  authority (True Size). GSC / Pokédex stay Classic 16×16.
- Pokémon Size is no longer a separate option — size follows Sprite Style.
- Wilds, followers, and Town Pokémon share generated geometry under
  `assets/wilds_generated/true_size/`.
- Voxel + incompatible Dramatic Shape still falls back to Classic geometry
  without rewriting saved options.

### Overworld catching

- Optional OW Catch throws at visible wilds (desktop C/Q plus mobile B-modifier).
- Compact ~6px world Poké Ball projectiles (unchanged by HUD size).
- Catch HUD Size now visibly scales the top-screen Ball inventory HUD as one
  component (icons, selection border, quantity, meter spacing). HUD uses
  full Ball art (not the tiny world `*_sm` sprites). Thrown Ball / projectile
  size stays fixed at ~6px.

### Water / levitate True Size scale consistency

- Swimming and levitate True Size presentations treat the species' **HGSS land
  opaque footprint** as absolute size authority (nearest-neighbor, uniform
  scale). Height is primary; width/area caps stop wide poses from looking
  larger than land. A final **0.95** presentation bias keeps water/levitate
  equal or slightly smaller than land — never larger.
- Regenerated for every species with HGSS land + swimming/levitate source art
  (not a 3-species prototype). Classic / GSC water runtime and Voxel unchanged.

### Followers & world presentation

- Improved follower/world presentation and land→water switches without sudden
  species-size jumps on True Size HGSS.
- GSC / Poke Followers swimming luminance is derived from coloured land sheets
  at load (no shipped `*_submerged.png` duplicates).

## 1.14.0

### True Size for all Gen1 species (Classic fallback sacred)

- Generalizes the Charizard prototype into a data-driven True Size system for
  all 151 land species plus swimming / levitate presentations where assets exist.
- **requestedMode** vs **effectiveMode**: Voxel with incompatible Dramatic Shape
  uses Classic geometry automatically; the saved `pokemon_size` preference is
  never rewritten, and Flat restores True Size on live rebind.
- New runtime assets under `assets/wilds_generated/true_size/` (HGSS from original
  followsprites, Followers/GSC, Pokédex 1-frame stand-ins, swimming, levitate).
- Wilds, followers, and Town Pokémon share `lib/species_geometry.lua`.
- Classic 16×16 pipelines and Voxel stability remain unchanged.

## 1.13.0

### Variable-size / True Size prototype (experimental)

- Inspected Gen1Recomp #1016 / PR #1020: SpriteDef now supports
  `frameWidth` / `frameHeight` / `anchorX` / `anchorY` with
  `SpriteRenderer:getPoseGeometry` (bottom-center default).
- Inspected Dramatic Shape **1.7.9**: `SpriteBillboards.buildCard` is still
  fixed 16×16 and does **not** call the geometry API — no DS monkey-patch.
- New **Pokémon Size** option: **Classic** (default) | **True Size**.
- Charizard-only HGSS Flat prototype (32×32 frames from original
  `followsprites`, not degraded 16×16 runtime). Voxel + True Size falls back
  to Classic with a DEV log until DS supports variable billboards.
- Full 151 migration intentionally **not** started.

## Unreleased

### Optional overworld Poké Ball catching

- New **OW CATCH** setting (`overworld_catching`, default **ON**) in
  START → OPTIONS → WILDS OF KANTO and Mod Settings.
- Hold **C** to charge a 1–6 tile power meter, release to throw; **Q** cycles
  Poké / Great / Ultra / Master Ball from the real bag inventory (skips empty;
  **E** is not used).
- Additional mobile/controller path (logical Gen1Recomp A/B/D-Pad, including
  TouchControls): hold **B** + **LEFT/RIGHT** to cycle Balls; hold **B** + **A**
  to charge, release **A** to throw. Short **B** taps stay vanilla; desktop
  **C**/**Q** are unchanged. No Gen1Recomp core patch.
- While charging, translucent green ground tiles preview the selected throw
  distance along facing (synced with the meter). Flat uses camera-native
  canvas space; Voxel uses Dramatic Shape `project()` from drawFx so zoom
  no longer drifts the markers.
-   Compact ~6px Ball projectiles; top-screen Ball HUD icons scale with
  **Catch HUD Size** (`catch_hud_size`, 1–10); success click + fail break
  presentation before cleanup.
- Catch sequence uses native Gen1Recomp SFX via `Sound.play`: `Ball_Toss`,
  `Ball_Poof`, `Tink`, `Caught_Mon` (no bundled audio files).
- Easter eggs: Ball hit on a human NPC → `"Ouch, yo, WTF"`; Town/Ambient
  Pokémon → `"Grrrr..."` (no catch/battle; Ball cleaned).
- Failed catches use `!` → AGGRESSIVE/chase (no forced instant battle); the
  same aggressive wild stays catchable until a real battle starts.
- Small top-right Ball HUD; directional targeting only (no side auto-aim).
- Catch math uses native `Catching.attempt` (species catch rate + Ball type)
  with mild level / throw-quality / facing (back/side) modifiers.
- Success removes the wild via Wilds despawn + Party/Box deposit; failure
  restores the mon, shows `!`, forces aggressive behaviour, and uses the
  existing Wilds battle pipeline. Safari sessions disable throws.
- Inspired by Gen1PC-OverworldEncounters catching concepts (reimplemented for
  Wilds entity / occupancy / battle architecture — not a verbatim port).

## 1.12.2

### Yellow door-exit follow — re-seeds walk the trail, never the building

- Re-seeds (the collapse-heuristic re-form, map-entry rebuilds and the
  mid-follow step fallback) now re-form the pack ALONG the player's actual
  walked trail cells instead of behind the anchor's geometric facing.  At a
  door the facing points INTO the building, and the behind cells can be an
  enclosed walkable pocket the pack can never path out of (e.g. the cells
  north of the Pewter Poke Center) — the "exit and turn right → pack stuck
  behind the building" bug.  Trail cells are walkable and connected by
  construction; a trailer with no trail cell parks on the anchor and walks
  out as the trail re-opens.  Surf entry (no trail yet) keeps the geometric
  water behind-seed.
- Fixed a latent nil-call (`_behindSeedCells` → `_seedTrailBehind`) that
  silently aborted the trailer update on the non-spawnAtPlayer re-seed
  paths, freezing the pack.
- Land entries with no real trail yet (the spawnAtPlayer parking raced or
  skipped, or a mid-play rebuild) now park the pack on the PLAYER's cell
  instead of spreading it behind the anchor's facing — the "loads in as the
  full-sized trail behind the building" symptom.  Water (surf) entry keeps
  its geometric behind-seed onto water cells.
- The WILDS HUD follower block now reports which re-seed branch placed the
  pack last (`Seed=parked_at_player | trail_reform | behind_water | kept`
  plus counters), so a live Yellow door-exit is diagnosable at a glance.
- New regression test `follower_pewter_exit_unit_test.lua` runs the real
  Pewter City walkability grid: door exit → walk down + turn right,
  stop-and-go, a mid-play collapse re-form, and a pre-existing pack
  surviving the engine's entity rebuild — the pack must trail east along
  the street and never land north of the Poke Center.

### Global Encounter Silhouettes (wild_silhouettes)

- New **ENC SILHOUETTE** toggle (Wilds of Kanto submenu + Mod Settings)
  that blacks out every overworld wild mon in an actual encounter zone
  (grass / cave land, plus water sprites) — the water-only silhouette look
  extended to all encounters.
- No extra sprite files: `LuminanceSheet.silhouetteFor` derives a solid
  black sheet from the single coloured art at load (every opaque pixel →
  the darkest shade, alpha carries the shape), cached in the save dir
  (`silo_v1_*`, separate namespace from the luma ramps).  Served with
  `trueColor = false` so the engine's own bake renders it as the darkest
  zone color; headless / derivation-unavailable keeps the coloured art.
- Gated per-entity: land mons only silhouette on GRASS/CAVE surfaces
  (previews, followers and non-encounter surfaces stay coloured); water
  black-out skips hidden circle markers and native voxel silhouette
  sheets.  Cache keys include the toggle so a live switch re-resolves
  without a reload.

### Yellow spawn-at-player — closing the stock-Pikachu respawn path

- The engine's `PikachuFollower.update` calls `onMapEntered(game, ow)`
  (no `viaMapLoad`) whenever it finds no follower mid-frame, which spawns
  the stock Pikachu BEHIND the player's facing.  If the engine's entry
  spawn was skipped or raced by a transitional frame, that re-spawn
  undid the spawn-at-player parking.  `wrappedOnMapEntered` now treats a
  no-`viaMapLoad` re-spawn as a fresh entry while the entry parking is
  still pending, so the stock Pikachu parks under the player instead of
  materializing behind him (Red/Blue was unaffected — no stock NPC).
- `_parkStockPikachuAtPlayer` now spawns the stock Pikachu on demand
  (via the engine's own spawn path, parked at the player) when it is
  missing at entry on Yellow, instead of silently no-op'ing.

### Yellow followers frozen at the entry cell ("stuck up top")

- Root cause: the pack parks on the player's cell at entry, and on the
  FIRST committed walk step the entry-parking marker cleared while the
  pack was still stacked on the stock Pikachu's cell.  The Yellow
  collapse heuristic (re-form the train when it stacks on the stock)
  then fired 1–2 steps after every door exit, re-seeding the pack
  BEHIND the anchor.  When those behind-cells were the building/wall
  just exited, `_walkableBehind` fell back to the anchor's own cell, so
  the re-seed stacked the pack on the anchor again — an infinite
  re-seed loop that froze the followers at the entry cell.  Red/Blue
  never runs the heuristic (no stock Pikachu), which is why only Yellow
  broke.
- The entry-parking marker now clears only once the pack has genuinely
  separated from the anchor (first trailer off its cell or mid-step
  away), and the heuristic only re-seeds when the cell behind the
  anchor is actually follower-walkable — a wall-pocket pack is left in
  place instead of being re-seeded into a re-seed loop.
- New regression test `follower_yellow_follow_unit_test.lua` interleaves
  the vanilla stock-Pikachu movement with the mod's update across a
  door-exit walk and asserts the parked pack walks out and trails the
  player (stock one cell behind, trailers in order, no gaps).

### Luminance shading: hue-aware shades fix washed-out blue mons

- The derived shade value now darkens blue-dominant pixels (Rec. 601 luma
  minus a blue-chroma penalty).  Luminance alone cannot separate colors of
  DIFFERENT hue at the same brightness, so Blastoise's light-blue shell
  (~0.63) and cream belly (~0.66) both collapsed into the light zone and
  the mon rendered as a white blob.  The blue shell now lands in the mid
  zone while the cream belly keeps the light zone — the GSC look — and the
  same fix covers Squirtle, Gyarados, Dratini, Lapras and other blue
  bodies against cream/warm parts.  Swept all 151 follower sheets: only
  legitimately dark mons (Gastly/Gengar/Heracross) keep no light zone.
  Cache files are version-tagged (v3) so stale derived ramps regenerate.

### WILDS AI toggle moved out of the engine's main Options

- The engine's Options → Display list showed a "WILDS AI" row for the
  `owwild_behavior_tick` render pipeline.  With the toggle now in the
  Wilds of Kanto submenu, the mod filters that row out of
  `Pipelines.rows` (the pipeline stays registered — it is the per-frame
  AI driver — only its options row is hidden).

### Yellow follower spawn-at-player — two real-world failure modes closed

- The Yellow "collapse" heuristic re-forms the train behind the stock
  Pikachu when the pack stacks on its cell — and it fired on the frame
  AFTER a fresh map entry, re-seeding the deliberately parked pack
  BEHIND the player.  Entry parking is now marked (`_wildsEntryParked`)
  and the heuristic is skipped until the head commits its first step.
- If the first update after a map entry runs on a not-yet-ready world
  (transitional frame), `syncTrailers` now reports `"no_context"` and
  `update` KEEPS the pending map-entry flags so the next frame still
  parks the pack at the player instead of seeding it behind his facing.

### WILDS AI menu toggle + reliable overworld contact battles

- Added a **WILDS AI** ON/OFF toggle to the Wilds of Kanto submenu (before
  IDLE MONS). It gates the `owwild_behavior_tick` render pipeline that runs
  wander / chase / contact logic every frame; OFF keeps spawns visible but
  frozen. New `wilds_ai` option, synced through `behavior_tick.lua`
  (`available`, `syncPipelineLevel`, `step`) and `spawn_logic.lua`.
- Fixed the AI pipeline silently switching itself OFF: the engine's
  `Pipelines.applyOptions` restores levels from the save right after mods
  load, wiping the level `register()` set — so the mod now re-asserts it on
  `game.ready` (and map enter / option changes already did).
- Walking into an overworld mon now reliably triggers a battle even when
  the AI loop hasn't ticked that frame: `SpawnFx` ages the spawn pop-in by
  wall-clock time as a fail-safe, so a freshly spawned mon becomes
  battleable (and the collision / stepped battle paths no longer stall on
  a never-finished spawn animation).

### Sprite color modes — luminance-based shading, derived at load, no duplicate sheets

- Luminance derivation is now per-sheet ADAPTIVE: the OBP0 bake collapses
  every shade above r = 0.5 into one zone, so a fixed light bucket turned
  light mons into flat white blobs (Snorlax's cream ~0.79 and body ~0.52
  both hit c0). The sheet's lightest high-coverage color keeps the light
  zone and a second, clearly darker light color is pulled to the mid zone,
  restoring tonal separation (Snorlax body → c1, Dragonite orange → c1 vs
  cream belly → c0). Cache files are version-tagged so stale derived ramps
  regenerate automatically.

Followers / surf / wild / ambient sprites now conform to whichever COLORS
mode is active via luminance-based shading:

- In every mode EXCEPT ADVANCED (RED++), the mod derives a 3-shade
  luminance ramp from the colored sheet at load (new `luminance_sheet.lua`:
  `love.image.newImageData` + `mapPixel` → `ImageData:encode` into the save
  dir, cached per source) and serves it with `trueColor = false`, so the
  ENGINE's native non-trueColor path handles it exactly like a vanilla DMG
  sprite: SpriteRenderer bakes rOBP0 = $D0 and the whole-canvas zone shader
  colors the result out of the mode's own palette. Brightness decides the
  shade, the engine decides the colors — SGB tints with the map palette,
  OG RED/BLUE with the boot-ROM object palette (green/pink), OG YELLOW
  with its CGBBasePalettes zones, CLASSIC / OG / OG INV with their
  green/gray ramps, SGB INV with the permuted palette.
- ADVANCED is the one true-color mode: there the original colored sheets
  are served with `trueColor = true` (draw raw + markTrueColor re-blit).
- **The 502 duplicate `-grayscale` / `-grayscale_submerged` asset files are
  deleted** — the luminance ramp is derived from the single colored source.
  The derived ramp clamps its lightest shade to r = 0.8 (< the 0.83 the
  engine's OBP0 bake keys transparent), so no interior pixel ever punches
  through; the pre-made sheets were pure white at that shade in 334 files.
  Headless environments (no LÖVE image APIs) fall back to the colored
  sheet with `trueColor = true`.
- `Config.spriteTrueColor()` is now the ADVANCED gate; the
  `paletteFxMonochrome` gate is kept for diagnostics / the water registry.
- `trueColor` travels with the art: consumers copy the flag from the
  resolved def instead of recomputing it, so colored art (external PokePC
  packs, water runtime sheets) always renders raw while luminance sheets
  flow through the zone pass.
- Fixed the surf/follow paths that hard-forced `trueColor = true` while
  serving luminance sheets (submerged poke_followers sheets, trailer
  water sprites, follower water resolver, water compat defs,
  `SPRITE_PIKACHU` registration).

### Yellow party order — selecting a follower no longer reorders the party

- Removed the leftover `ensureYellowLeaderLayout` call from `syncAll`. In
  Yellow, picking "Follow" on any party mon other than Pikachu physically
  rewrote the party array to force Pikachu into slot 1; Wilds designates the
  follower via save data (`pokepcLeader` / `followerPartyIndex`), so the
  party order is left untouched. The now-unused function was deleted.
- Yellow: the stock Pikachu NPC renders the SELECTED leader's art (slot 1),
  and the party Pikachu trails like any other party mon unless it IS the
  leader — so Pikachu appears when in the party without taking priority
  over the chosen follower, and never renders twice.

### Followers spawn at the player on map entry

- After a warp / door exit / boot, the pack now parks on the player's cell
  (like the engine's stock Yellow Pikachu) and walks out from under him as
  the trail opens, instead of materializing in the cells behind his facing —
  which could drop them inside walls or behind the building. Seamless
  outside-to-outside connection crossings keep the existing translated
  train.
- Yellow: the `PikachuFollower.onMapEntered` wrapper was dropping the
  engine's `viaMapLoad` flag (the 4th argument), so the stock Pikachu
  respawned behind the player on door/warp exits instead of under him —
  getting stuck behind buildings. The wrapper now passes the trailing args
  through, trailer seeding anchors to the player's cell (not the trail
  anchor), and the stock Pikachu is parked on the player's cell explicitly
  at every fresh map entry (engine-version independent), so the whole pack
  parks under the player on Yellow too.

## 1.12.1
- Menu now supports controller.
- A button will increment/cycle through sub-menu options.
- Removes the duplicate "FOLLOWER" in party menu.
- Replaces "FOLLOWER"/"FOLLOWING" with "FOLLOW"/"DISMISS".

## 1.12.0

### Followers EX walk cycle fix — no more dragging trailers

- **Root cause**: Followers EX (priority 160) wraps its hooks on top of Wilds'
  (priority 80) ControlEngine wrappers after `game.ready`. The restore-then-reinstall
  path had equality guards (`PF.update == wrappedUpdate`) that failed when EX's
  wrapper sat on top, making restore a no-op. EX's hook logic double-drove the
  pack, breaking walk-phase overrides and causing 2nd+ followers to drag along
  without animating.
- **Fix**: `ControlEngine:restore()` and `_restoreOverworldUpdateWrap()` now
  unconditionally restore to the vanilla originals captured at first `install()`.
  On `game.ready`, the re-wrap strips Followers EX out of the update chain
  entirely — equivalent to how things worked when EX's init crashed, but deliberate
  and clean.
- Added `setOptionsChangedHandler` to the mod interface: Followers EX calls this
  to hook in; the handler detects the attempt and schedules the restore+reinstall
  for the first `game.ready` frame after EX finishes its init.

### Submerged / water follower sprites (poke_followers)

- **File naming updated**: All poke_followers sprites now live in a single flat
  directory: `follower_NNN_normal.png`, `follower_NNN_shiny.png`,
  `follower_NNN_grayscale.png`, `follower_NNN_submerged.png`,
  `follower_NNN_normal_submerged.png`, `follower_NNN_shiny_submerged.png`,
  `follower_NNN_grayscale_submerged.png`.
- **Direct file loading bypasses `mod:read`**: The `mod:read` existence check
  silently failed for binary assets in some engine configurations. All submerged
  resolution paths now use `love.filesystem.getInfo` directly. This applies to
  follower trailers (`_refreshTrailerWaterSprites`), the follower water resolver
  (`SpawnLogic:resolveWaterSprite`), wild water encounters
  (`SpriteResolver:resolveWaterSprite`), and the provider chain
  (`followers_ex:resolveWater`).
- **Surface transition tracking**: `ControlEngine:update` now tracks the trail
  surface each frame. On any land↔water transition, `_refreshTrailerWaterSprites`
  re-resolves every party-mon trailer sprite — submerged sheets apply immediately
  on entering water, land sheets restore on exit.
- **Post-battle / party-change resilience**: After battle or party changes,
  `syncTrailers` may recreate trailer entities with fresh land sprites while
  still on water. Detecting entity reference changes while surface is water now
  triggers a sprite refresh.
- **Sprite style gating**: Submerged poke_followers sheets only activate when the
  selected sprite style is `"followers"` (GSC). HGSS/PokeMMO and Pokédex styles
  continue to use the swimming/levitates water registry.
- **Wild water encounters** also get submerged poke_followers art (gated on
  followers style) via `SpriteResolver:resolveWaterSprite`.

### POKE FOLLOW EX & WILDS OF KANTO sub-menus — stepper refactor

- **Every option now cycles with left/right arrow keys** instead of opening a
  dropdown sub-menu. Each row is self-contained: left decreases, right increases,
  the label updates instantly, and the value takes effect immediately.
- **Left arrow detection fix**: The engine's `input:wasPressed` API was unreliable
  in the menu context. Steppers now poll `love.keyboard.isDown` directly with
  manual edge detection and hold-to-repeat (16-frame initial delay, 4-frame cadence).
- **Follower count stepper now applies**: The count change writes to
  `game.save.pokepcFollowerCount` and `mod.options`, sets a pending-sync flag,
  and the control engine detects the count mismatch on its next update frame.
  Follower count wraps 0↔6 at the ends.
- **Label overlap eliminated**: All labels and values shortened to fit within the
  16-character Game Boy screen limit. `CONTROL MODE` → `CONTROL`,
  `TRAINER TRAIL` → `TRAIL`, `SPAWN AMOUNT` → `SPAWN AMT`,
  `SPRITE STYLE` → `GFX STYLE`, values like `HGSS / PokeMMO` → `HGSS`,
  `Reachable Only` → `REACH`, etc.
- **LEADER row removed** from POKE FOLLOW EX sub-menu — follower deselection via
  the party menu is the cleaner path.

### Party menu follower selection

- Non-active party mons show **FOLLOWER**; the currently-active mon shows
  **ACTIVE**. Legacy rows (LEADER, FOLLOWING) are actively stripped.
- Selecting **ACTIVE** deselects the follower: clears the leader, sets follower
  count to 0, removes trailers, and shows the confirmation message
  `"<name> is no longer following."` via the engine's TextBox stack.
- `getActiveFollowerMon` and `getLeaderMon` return `nil` when `followerCount ≤ 0`,
  preventing the ACTIVE label from persisting after deselection.

### Yellow version Pikachu quirk

- Removed `ensureYellowLeaderLayout` — it was physically reordering the party
  array to put Pikachu in slot 1 whenever a follower was selected. Wilds'
  trailer system designates the follower via save data (`pokepcLeader`),
  not party order.

### TEST SPAWN cleanup

- Removed the duplicate top-level "Test Spawn" row from the OPTIONS menu
  (was registered separately in `preview_browser.lua`). Now only appears
  inside the WILDS OF KANTO sub-menu.

### PC Grid UI integration

- Exposed `_G._wildsSpriteService` from `main.lua` so other mods can resolve
  follower-style overworld icons.

## 1.11.1

### Fix Poke Followers EX OPTIONS menu follower settings path

- Root cause: Gen1Recomp has **no** `mod.options:set` (only `define`/`get`).
  In-game menus were silently failing option writes via `pcall(options:set)`
- Menus now write the same `loader.modOptions` / `save.options.modOptions`
  buckets Mod Manager uses (`Config.setOption`)
- Shared `handleOptionsChanged` from `main.lua` is injected into SettingsMenus
  (no duplicated logic/follower/ambient notify path)
- ListMenu navigation uses close-then-push so parent is not left stale under
  child (`ListMenu:close` only pops when it is stack top)
- Control Mode, Trainer Trail, and Followers (0–6) share that path
- Regression tests simulate the real ListMenu choose → child → apply flow
  (`tests/settings_menus_listmenu_path_unit_test.lua`)

### Remove Sprite Color mode; fix GSC true-color rendering

- Removed the Sprite Color (Colored / Classic) option and its submenu entry
- Follower, wild, ambient, and party-menu sprites now always render true-color
- Fixes the built-in Poke Followers / GSC sheets (8-bit RGBA) being force-baked
  through the 4-shade DMG gray ramp in Classic mode, which made them look broken
- Legacy "classic" saves are ignored and migrated to "colored"

## 1.11.0

### OPTIONS menus, Sprite Color / Fade, Town Pokémon

- Moved Wilds and follower settings into START → OPTIONS submenus
- Restored Wilds Sprite Fade setting (Solid / Faded; Solid = alpha 1.0)
- Added peaceful Town Pokémon (ambient NPCs; Idle / Wander only)
- Added ambient Pokémon interactions and text cries
- Ambient Pokémon use the selected Sprite Style
- Updated README for the collaborative Wilds of Kanto project
- Both OPTIONS submenus share the same central `mod.options` keys as Mod Settings
- No top-level START menu entries for Wilds / Followers

## 1.10.0

### Sprite defaults, built-in GSC pack, menus (PR #38 follow-up)

- Poke Followers / GSC is now the default overworld sprite style
- Added built-in GSC/Poke Followers sprite set (`assets/enhanced_overworld/poke_followers`)
- Rebuilt HGSS/PokeMMO runtime sprites with improved detail preservation
  (nearest-neighbor only, shared pivot, no source mutation)
- Added **Poke Followers EX** in-game Start Menu submenu (`POKE FOLLOW EX`)
- Added **Wilds of Kanto** in-game Start Menu submenu
- Unified menu settings with Mod Settings (same `mod.options` keys)
- Preserved Voxel-compatible native SpriteRenderer path
- Existing explicit sprite-style saves are not overwritten; invalid/missing
  values migrate to Poke Followers / GSC

### Follower water movement (PR #38 follow-up)

- Fixed pack/trailer freeze on Surf: trail goals and steps are surface-aware for
  Pokémon follower roles only (`primary`, `party_trailer`)
- **Decoupled trailer ticks from `PikachuFollower.update`:** `ControlEngine:update`
  runs from an `OverworldController.update` wrap every logic frame (including Surf)
- Trailer `npc.update` is a no-op; `advanceTrailerStep` runs once per control update
- `shouldSpawn` may suppress stock Pikachu while surfing without stopping Wilds trailers
- Surf trail anchor is always the player (Yellow stock Pikachu is not used on water)
- Trainer trailers are hidden while surfing and restored on land (no swim)
- `FollowersWaterCompat` updates every Pokémon trailer with a per-entity cache
  and `entity.pokepcMon` species (no shared active-entity overwrite)
- Sprite rebind preserves `moving` / `targetX` / `targetY` / `progress`
- Tests: `tests/follower_water_movement_unit_test.lua`,
  `tests/follower_control_update_unit_test.lua`

### Unified follower core — standalone (PR 1 follow-up)

- Wilds no longer requires Followers EX or PokéPC Followers to run
- Registered `SPRITE_PIKACHU` at load from built-in HGSS/PokeMMO walker sheets
  (fixes standalone crash when companion mods are absent)
- Ported Followers EX ControlEngine concepts into `lib/follower/control_engine.lua`
  (control modes, trainer trail, follower count 0–6, pack trailers)
- Added Wilds Mod Settings: Control Mode, Trainer Trail, Followers
- Migrates legacy FOLLOWERS_EX / pokepc* / selected_mon settings once
- PokéPC party selection, fingerprint (now includes species), talk, and
  persistence remain built-in
- Legacy companion mods are detected for migration only; Wilds owns runtime
- Reuses existing Wilds runtime walker sheets (no PokéPC asset copy required)
- Prepared `resolveFollowerSprite` for the shared resolver (PR 2)
- Box LEADER UI and town-borrow spawns remain documented follow-ups

### Earlier 1.10.0 draft notes

- Integrated PokéPC follower selection and persistence into Wilds
- Integrated Followers EX follower lifecycle concepts (single-follower owner)
- Added Red, Blue and Yellow follower compatibility
- Documented the safe-location sprite reset root cause
- Credits: masterwebx / Followers EX, gamecorner-033 / PokéPC Followers

## 1.9.0

### Sprite Style simplification + Voxel water shadows

- Simplified Sprite Style options to HGSS/PokeMMO, Poke Followers and Pokedex
- Set HGSS/PokeMMO as the default sprite style
- Fixed Hidden Silhouettes being invisible in Voxel mode
- Added a generic question-mark-free underwater shadow marker
- Changed Voxel Silhouettes to render as flat underwater shadows
- Preserved Flat 2D water presentation

## 1.8.0

### Water Pokémon display modes + cave reachability

- Replaced the Water Mons on/off toggle with five presentation modes:
  **Swim Sprites** (default), **Hid Silhouette**, **Silhouettes**,
  **Classic Enc**, **Disabled**
- **Swim Sprites** preserves the previous swimming / levitates behaviour 100%
- **Hid Silhouette** keeps water AI / chase / collision, draws only a small
  dark animated circle on the water surface (no Pokémon sprite)
- **Silhouettes** Flat 2D: temporary dark blue-teal draw tint + proximity
  brightness + sink. Voxel: native pre-rendered 16×96 silhouette sheets for
  correct Dramatic Shape depth / occlusion (no runtime tint, no emergency body)
- Fixed Water Silhouettes in Voxel mode using native pre-rendered sheets
- Preserved the existing Flat 2D water presentation
- Prevented normal Water sprites from leaking into Voxel silhouette modes
- **Classic Enc** / **Disabled** water RNG overrides unchanged
- Added **Cave Spawns** choice: **Reachable Only** (default) / **Mixed**
- Restricted normal cave spawns to player-reachable areas (not mere walkability)
- Mixed allows ~20% atmospheric scenery in inaccessible cave pockets
- Prevented unreachable scenery Pokémon from chasing through walls
- Legacy Water Mons: `true` → `swimming_sprites`, `false` → `classic_encounters`

## 1.7.1

### PokeMMO walk frames + follower swap stability + aggressive search wander

- **Root cause of frozen PokeMMO walk:** runtime sheet generator picked source
  column 1 (idle bob). After bottom-align fit, idle and walk frames were
  pixel-identical, so `phase` 0/1 could not change the drawn frame.
- Generator now picks the first walk column whose silhouette differs from idle
  (typically column 2). Regenerated all follow-sprite and water runtime sheets.
- Native walker sheets still use Gen1Recomp's 6-frame stand/walk contract;
  extra source walk frames remain unused by design.
- Removed speculative Followers sprite-API probing; only verified
  `getActiveFollowerMon` is used.
- Stabilized active-follower selection (sticky entity) and skip
  `SpriteRenderer.new` when the bound def is unchanged.
- Kept `usingEnhancedSprite = false` for native sheets and aggressive search
  wander from the earlier 1.7.1 draft.
- Safari / SAFARI_FLEE behaviour unchanged.

## 1.7.0

### Safari Zone compatibility + Safari Flee

- Added native Safari encounter routing for visible Pokémon
- Disabled normal aggressive behaviour inside active Safari sessions
- Added Safari Flee behaviour for selected Pokémon
- Added alert and short-distance escape movement
- Preserved native Safari catch and flee mechanics
- Disabled step-based encounters during visible Safari gameplay
- Added safe Vanilla Safari fallback

## 1.6.0

### Settings consolidation + cave / water / overlay / follower style

- Consolidated all gameplay settings into Mod Settings
- Removed obsolete and duplicate developer options
- Added behaviour/facing developer overlay
- Preserved the Pokémon test-spawn selector
- Restricted cave spawns and movement to reachable cells
- Reduced visible water Pokémon density and increased spacing
- Applied selected sprite style to the active follower
- Added follower Swimming/Levitates sprite transitions

## 1.5.0

### World collision + follower water sprites

- Prevented overlapping wild Pokémon spawns
- Added atomic movement target reservations
- Prevented wild Pokémon from walking through entities
- Added optional follower Swimming/Levitates sprite switching
- Fixed land-to-water chase entry: reserve free water cell before sprite swap
- Kept committed land surface until the first water tile commits
- Prefer alternate free shore water cells when the direct entry is occupied
- Temporary occupancy blocks no longer abort shore chases
- Preserved native SpriteRenderer rendering

## 1.4.1

### Water spawn / aggro / sprite-style regressions

- Restored land aggressive chase as a separate state machine from water
- Added SpawnFx fail-safe so AI/battle cannot stay blocked forever
- Fixed movement busy invariants and alert chaseReady timeout
- Water Behaviour empty-pool fallback is `WATER_IDLE` (not land `IDLE_LOOK`)
- Relaxed water zone/rod filters; raised water spawn targets (`max_water_mons=12`)
- Diversity soft-fails instead of emptying water pools
- Added `WaterSpawn.isWaterCapable` (types → swimming/levitates → local encounters)
- SpriteResolver cache keys include `species:variant:form:surface:style`
- Explicit PokeMMO rejects Followers EX on land; style wrap re-asserted on spawn

## 1.4.0

### Water spawn variety + chase

- Added Surf and fishing encounter pools to visible water spawns
- Added shore-distance-based water spawn zones
- Added deep-water-only Super Rod species
- Improved visible water Pokémon variety
- Added aggressive water Pokémon
- Added land-to-water chase transitions for compatible aggressive Pokémon
- Added automatic Swimming/Levitates sprite transition during water chase
- Prevented water Pokémon from chasing onto land

## 1.3.0

### Water Pokémon sprites (Swimming / Levitates)

- Added dedicated Swimming sprites for visible water Pokémon
- Added Levitates water-sprite fallback
- Added normal and shiny water variants
- Added Pokédex-ID-based water sprite mapping
- Added automatic water sprite fallback independent of selected land style
- Reused the native SpriteRenderer animation pipeline
- Added water sprite validation and diagnostics

## 1.2.0

### Removed Hidden Idle; Random Enc + Water Mons

- Removed Hidden Idle grass encounter mode
- Removed periodic grass rustle and reveal effects
- Replaced Grass Enc choice with simple **Random Enc** toggle (`random_encounters`,
  default ON) covering classic grass / cave / water step encounters
- Preserved visible overworld Pokémon and water spawns
- Kept visible grass and water spawn animations (lift/splash; no grass rustle)
- Simplified in-game settings: **SPRITE STYLE**, **SPAWN AMOUNT**, **RANDOM ENC**,
  **WATER MONS**
- Added **Water Mons** (`water_spawns`, default ON): visible Pokémon from the
  map water encounter table on connected water (`WATER_IDLE` / `WATER_WANDER`)
- Migrates saved `grass_encounters` once:
  `classic`/`both` → Random Enc ON, `hidden` → OFF
- Spawn Amount remains Start-Menu only

## 1.1.0

### Grass Enc + Hidden Idle

- Added **Grass Enc** (`grass_encounters`): Classic / Hidden / Both.
  **Hidden** is the default.
- **Hidden Idle** lurkers reserve grass tiles, rustle with native tall-grass
  redraws, reveal on step (rustle → body → short hop → battle once).
- Classic grass RNG follows the selected mode; in **Both**, Hidden Idle wins
  on a reserved cell (no double encounter). Caves and water are unchanged.
- Start Menu quick settings order: **SPRITE STYLE**, **SPAWN AMOUNT**,
  **GRASS ENC**.
- **Spawn Amount** removed from Mod Settings (internal `spawn_density` key
  and density math unchanged); still adjustable from the Start Menu.
- Developer HUD reports grass-encounter mode, hidden targets, and per-entity
  Hidden Idle state.

## 1.0.2

### Sprite providers + quick picker

- Added optional **Gold Sprites** provider support
  (`Gold_Silver_Sprites` battle fronts via read-only `mod:find()` adapter).
- Quick sprite style selection from the normal in-game Start Menu
  (**SPRITE STYLE**), writing the same `sprite_style` option as Mod Settings.
- Switch between **Auto**, **Gold Sprites**, **Followers EX**, **PokeMMO**,
  and **Pokedex**; Auto prefers Gold → Followers EX → PokeMMO → Pokedex.
- Improved provider fallbacks when optional mods are missing, plus clearer
  HUD/status reporting and documentation for the provider matrix.

## 1.0.0

### Stable release

- First stable major release of Wilds of Kanto.
- Native trainer/NPC-compatible `SpriteRenderer` rendering for wild Pokemon.
- Improved Dramatic Shape and first-person compatibility (depth, walls, grass,
  shadows) on the native sheet path.
- Animated overworld sprites via follow-sprite runtime sheets.
- Wall and object occlusion through the Dramatic Shape / engine billboard path.
- Simplified mod settings for version 1.0.
- All visible setting labels limited to 14 characters (Gen1Recomp truncation).
- Removed obsolete and non-functional public settings (density fine-tuning,
  legacy sprite size / opacity menus, old strict billboard debug probes, and
  legacy option aliases).
- GitHub update support via manifest `github` field
  (`YoDrehDenSwagAuf/overworld-spawn-mod`).
- MIT license for original project source plus third-party notices for
  non-MIT assets.
- Automated tag-triggered release workflow producing
  `wilds-of-kanto-v1.0.0.zip` with `manifest.json` at the ZIP root.

### Settings (public)

| Label | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Show Wild Mons | Master switch for visible wilds | ON |
| Hide Grass RNG | Suppress vanilla grass rolls when ready | ON |
| Sprite Style | Auto / Gold Sprites / Followers EX / PokeMMO / Pokedex | AUTO |
| Spawn Amount | Density preset | NORMAL |
| Grass View | Immersed vs above tall grass | IMMERSED |
| Idle Mons | Allow idle look behaviour | ON |
| Roam Mons | Allow wandering | ON |
| Chase Mons | Allow aggressive chase | ON |
| Hidden Mons | Allow hidden markers | ON |
| Dev Mode | Diagnostics / preview browser | OFF |

Internal option keys for the remaining settings are unchanged so existing
saved values keep working.

## 0.7.1

### Fixed

- **Question-mark fallback despite generated sheets**: `RuntimeSheets` now
  resolves sheets through `mod.assets:path(relative)` (the same load path
  Gen1Recomp `Assets.image` / `SpriteRenderer` expect) instead of registering
  bare `assets/wilds_generated/...` relative paths. Existence checks use `mod.read`
  / resolved load paths — `love.filesystem.getInfo(relative)` alone no longer
  decides that a packaged mod asset is missing.
- Registration for valid dex IDs writes `kind=native_runtime_sheet`,
  `frames=6`, `walker=true`, and the mod-resolved `def.image`.
- Developer HUD shows relative path, resolved path, registration kind, and
  fallback reason. Probe logs for dex 1 / 25 / 151 run at content registration.

### Required after update

- Replace the old mod ZIP completely (do not leave two copies installed).
- Fully restart the game so the content registry reloads.
- Clear any stale `overworld_wild_spawns-cache/` in the save directory if an
  older bake still shadows species sprites.

## 0.7.0

### Changed

- **Native SpriteRenderer path for wild Pokemon.** Visible wilds now use the
  same trainer/NPC contract Dramatic Shape already supports: a stable
  `SpriteRenderer` with `frames=6`, `walker=true`, and a static 16×96 sheet.
- Build-time generator writes
  `assets/wilds_generated/followsprites_runtime/{dex}-{normal|shiny}.png` from the
  follow-sprite source atlas (nearest-neighbor, bottom-center, shared scale).
- `pose()` returns NPC-compatible `facing` / `phase` / `flip` (`Movement.walkPhase`
  + `stepFlip`). Right-facing uses the engine left-frame mirror.
- Primary renderer label: `NATIVE_SPRITE_RENDERER`. First Person, depth buffer,
  wall/building occlusion, grass, shadows, and silhouettes come from Dramatic
  Shape with no Wilds-specific body overlay on the success path.
- `EnhancedWorldSprite` dynamic 16×16 cards remain in-repo as deprecated
  compatibility code and are unused for the Pokemon body.

### Frame order (verified against Gen1Recomp `SpriteRenderer.lua`)

```text
0 idle down / 1 idle up / 2 idle left
3 walk down / 4 walk up / 5 walk left
```

### Fallback chain

1. Generated runtime sheet (requested variant)
2. Generated runtime sheet (normal)
3. Legacy Pokédex / battle PNG as SpriteRenderer
4. Black fallback as SpriteRenderer

## 0.6.0

### Changed

- **Follow-sprites replace the Anima atlas** as the active enhanced overworld
  sprite source. One PNG per species/variant under
  `assets/enhanced_overworld/followsprites/`, with a shared
  `followsprites_mapping.json`.
- Species identity remains Pokédex / species ID only (never localized names).
- Idle and walk animations in four directions; walk uses a 4-frame cycle per
  direction (rows = directions, columns = frames — verified against the real
  PNGs).
- Normal and shiny files are mapped; **runtime Gen1 wild spawns always use
  normal** because Gen1Recomp does not expose a reliable pre-battle shiny flag.
  The developer preview browser can still force Shiny for inspection.
- Public option kept as enhanced overworld sprites
  (`use_animated_overworld_sprites`); it now toggles follow-sprites vs legacy
  Pokédex images. The old Anima atlas is no longer selectable.
- Commercial `POKEMON 1.png` is gitignored and blocked from release ZIPs.
  Old per-species Anima mapping JSONs remain in the repo unused.

### Fallback chain

1. Requested follow-sprite variant
2. Normal follow-sprite (if shiny missing)
3. Legacy Pokédex / battle PNG
4. Black fallback

## 0.5.7

### Added

- **Animated overworld Pokémon sprites** for all 151 Gen I species: directional
  idle and walk animations, language-independent Pokédex/species-ID mapping,
  and automatic fallback to the previous Pokédex-image presentation when the
  option is off or a mapping is missing/invalid.
- Mod option: **Use animated overworld Pokemon sprites**
  (`use_animated_overworld_sprites`, default on).
- Sprite credit: animated overworld art is based on Anima’s **GBC Pokémon**
  pack — https://anima-nel.itch.io/gbc-pokemon

### Diagnosis / Fixed

- **Honest render-path instrumentation**: HUD now shows Requested vs Actual body
  renderer from real call counters (`poseCalls`, `enhancedResolveImageCalls`,
  emergency/post-voxel body draws, mesh/Assets probes) instead of wishful status.
- **`strict_world_billboard_debug`**: disables emergency/post-voxel Pokemon body
  draws so a broken DS billboard path can no longer hide behind an overlay.
- Optional **`strict_magenta_billboard_probe`** for a magenta 16×16 DS texture probe.
- **Entity:draw no longer paints the body** when `WORLD_BILLBOARD_*` owns it
  (prevents double-draw on top of voxel grass).
- `worldBillboardReady` is per-entity only; ENHANCED requires card READY +
  loadable `def.image` + SpriteBillboards mesh probe.
- Depth/grass HUD flags stay `UNVERIFIED` until counters prove
  `DRAMATIC_SPRITE_BILLBOARD`.

## 0.5.6

### Fixed / Changed

- **Stable `EnhancedWorldSprite` adapter**: Dramatic Shape receives a dedicated
  SpriteRenderer-compatible object (`def` + `resolveImage()`), not a mutated
  legacy SpriteRenderer. Legacy sprites stay untouched for the flat 2D path.
- `Entity:getWorldSprite()` / `Entity:pose()` deliver the adapter with
  `phase = 0` and `frames = 1`; frame changes come only from cached 16×16
  billboard cards returned by `resolveImage()`.
- UV mesh carrier is the static transparent
  `assets/runtime/dynamic_billboard_base.png`; live pixels stay on the card
  Image cache (`species:anim:dir:frame:w:h`).
- Post-voxel Pokemon **body** draw remains emergency-only
  (`SPATIAL_OVERLAY_EMERGENCY`). Success path uses native DS depth + grass mesh.
- `immersed` grass: `Grass renderer: DRAMATIC_SHAPE_NATIVE` (no custom grass
  color/mask). `above`: small `visualY` lift (`grass_above_lift_px`); object
  occlusion stays active.
- `animation.renderRevision` bumps only on visible animation changes.
- Developer HUD fields for adapter status, card cache, ground/visual Y, lift,
  and grass renderer.

## 0.5.5

### Fixed

- **Pokemon appearing in front of bushes / world objects with Dramatic Shape**:
  the post-voxel 2D overlay drew Pokemon after the finished scene, so they had
  no depth. Wild Pokemon now use Dramatic Shape `SpriteBillboards` again via
  `pose()` → cached 16×16 trueColor atlas cards (`WORLD_BILLBOARD_ENHANCED`),
  sharing player/trainer depth and object occlusion.
- Post-voxel body draw is only an emergency `SPATIAL_OVERLAY_FALLBACK`.
  Emotes/debug stay on the overlay seam.

### Changed

- `above` grass mode no longer means “screen overlay”; it only skips grass
  feet cover while world occlusion stays active.

## 0.5.4

### Added

- **Pokemon grass rendering** option (`pokemon_grass_render_mode`):
  - `immersed` (default) — lower part of the sprite hidden by tall-grass
    feet-overdraw, like the player and trainers
  - `above` — fully visible above grass (previous post-voxel look)
- Uses Gen1Recomp `TileRenderer:drawCellBottom` on the flat path (engine) and
  the same call after the post-voxel 2D Pokemon draw when Dramatic Shape is on
- Live toggle; legacy `show_pokemon_in_grass=false` maps to `above`
- Preview browser: Preview grass Immersed/Above toggle
- Developer HUD: grass mode / occlusion active / height

## 0.5.3

### Changed

- **Voxel wild Pokemon architecture**: abandoned atlas→16×16 card→Dramatic
  Shape billboard conversion. Dramatic Shape still renders the voxel world;
  Wilds of Kanto draws animated Pokemon with the **same** 2D atlas renderer
  as a post-voxel overlay (`WILDS_2D_POST_VOXEL`), using `Voxel3D.project`
  for screen placement. Wild entities with enhanced sprites are skipped from
  Dramatic Shape `posesOf` so Voxel does not also draw a legacy billboard
  (no double sprite).

### Known

- Post-voxel overlays are drawn after the 3D depth pass, so buildings do not
  occlude Pokemon bodies on this path (depth integration inactive).

## 0.5.1

### Fixed

- **Voxel Mod invisible / static wild sprites**: Dramatic Shape billboards
  expected `SpriteRenderer` sheets; animated atlas frames are now baked into
  cached 16×16 cards for the voxel path while 2D keeps atlas+quad.

## 0.5.0
